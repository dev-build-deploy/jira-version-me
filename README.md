# Jira Version Me

JiraVersionMe provides a [GitHub Action](#github-action), and [Command Line Interface](./docs/cli.md) for managing Jira Versions.
The created releases are sorted based on SemVer 2.0 precedence, allowing you to use JQL for queries such as:

```
project=TEST AND fixVersion >=1.0.0 AND fixVersion <2.0.0
```

> [!WARNING]
> The action expects that the initial versions are already sorted correctly.
>
> If this is not the case, please use the provided [CLI tool to sort your project Versions](#sorting-all-releases).
